cacheSolve & makeCacheMatrix are used in conjunction as follows:

## create a test matrix with a command such as the one below. 
> testMatrix <- matrix(rnorm(16),4,4)

## It is important that the matrix be invertible, hence the use of rnorm. Otherwise, an error is returned if the matrix is singular

## next run makeCacheMatrix and store return value in M1
> M1 <- makeCacheMatrix(testMatrix)

## last run cacheSolve on M1
> cacheSolve(M1)

## if the inverse of the matrix has not been cached already, the script prints out the message "didn't use cached data" along with result
## if the inverse of the matrix has already cached, the script prints out the message "using cached data" along with result
